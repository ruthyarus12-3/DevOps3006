The Ukrainian military is not giving
away many specifics but Vadim Denysenko,
a senior official at the Interior Ministry,
said Wednesday that in the past two weeks, "above all things

thanks to the weapons that Ukraine received, we were able to destroy
approximately two dozen warehouses with weapons and stocks of fuel and
lubricants. This will certainly affect the intensity of fire" the
Russians can muster, he said.
